# Dotfiles
Dotfiles that I've spent time configuring.

## iTerm2
In `Settings` > `General` > `Preferences` enable "Load preferences from a custom folder or URL" and change to the iTerm2 folder.

## Raycast
The `.rayconfig` file is encrypted since it contains credentials. I left it in the repo for personal use but it isn't accessible otherwise.

## Vim
I wrote `.vimrc` myself but borrowed from Amix's setup [here](https://github.com/amix/vimrc).

## Zsh
Create a `.private` file in the `zsh` folder for loading things like API keys that should be kept offline.

## *Disclaimer*
*All of these are set up for MacOS and my personal computer. I can't make any promises about whether they'll work on another OS or machine.*
